On 12/31/2026, we will begin restricting updates to sensitive properties on non-draft email messages (including subject, body, and recipients). Apps will need Mail-Advanced.ReadWrite (or .All / .Shared) with admin consent to continue modifying these fields. Review your current usage and update permissions now to avoid unexpected failures.
